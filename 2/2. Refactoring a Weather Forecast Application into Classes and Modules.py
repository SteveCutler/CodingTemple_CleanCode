# Objective:
# The aim of this assignment is to refactor an existing Python script for a weather forecast 
# application into a more structured, object-oriented, and modular format. The focus will 
# be on identifying parts of the script that can be encapsulated into classes and organizing 
# these classes into appropriate modules to enhance code readability, maintainability, and scalability.

# Task 1: Identifying and Creating Classes

# Analyze the provided script and identify distinct functionalities that can be encapsulated 
# into classes. Create classes that represent different aspects of the weather forecast 
# application, 

# such as fetching data, 
# parsing data, and 
# user interaction.

# Problem Statement:

# The existing script for the weather forecast application is written in a procedural
#     style and lacks organization.

# Code Example:

# Before Refactoring:

# # Weather Forecast Application Script







# Expected Outcome:

# Clear definitions of classes such as 

# WeatherDataFetcher, 
# DataParser, and 
# UserInterface, 

# each handling specific parts of the application.

        # Task 2: Creating Modules

# Separate the classes into different modules based on their functionality. For instance, 
# all data-related classes can be in one module, and user interaction in another.

# Problem Statement:

# To enhance the modularity of the application, different functionalities need to be 
# separated into distinct modules.

# Code Example:

# weather_data.py

# class WeatherDataFetcher:
#     # Logic for fetching weather data
#     pass

# class DataParser:
#     # Logic for parsing weather data
#     pass

# user_interface.py

# class UserInterface:
#     # Logic for user interaction
#     pass

# Expected Outcome:

# Organized code with a clear module structure, where each module contains classes related 
# to specific functionalities of the application.

        # Task 3: Integrating Modules in the Main Application

# Develop the main application script that integrates the modules. This script should create 
# instances of the necessary classes and coordinate the overall functioning of the application.

# Problem Statement:

# The main application needs to effectively utilize the created modules to provide a seamless 
# weather forecasting experience.

# Code Example:

# main.py

# from weather_data import WeatherDataFetcher, DataParser
# from user_interface import UserInterface

# # Code to integrate modules and coordinate application functionality

# Expected Outcome:

# A main.py script that demonstrates how the different modules and classes come together to 
# form a fully functional weather forecast application. The script should exemplify the benefits 
# of using OOP and modular programming in Python.
